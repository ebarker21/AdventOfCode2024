Set the path/to/example in the arguments before running the code.

This Day's first part was about sorting then comparing two long lists of unsorted numbers to find the "distance" 
between them (ex. left is 3, right is 4, the distance is then 1). The total distance between all the numbers was the
answer.
The second part was about finding how often the right side had a target number on the left then multiplying said 
target number by the returned count. These numbers were added up for the final answer.
